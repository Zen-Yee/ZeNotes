# ZeNotes

ZeNotes is my personal developer knowledge base and snippet vault — a growing collection of notes, explanations, and reusable code examples across languages and frameworks.

## 📘 Structure

- **/docs/** — topic-based learning notes  
- **/_sidebar.md** — Docsify navigation  

## 💡 Purpose
To keep everything I learn — from design patterns to small shell tricks — in one place, versioned and publicly accessible.
